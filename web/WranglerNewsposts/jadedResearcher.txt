2019-01-18: This is a canon mutation and only kr can stop me: <br><img src = 'images/newspostImages/rainbowHorns.gif'>
2019-01-17: Been working on a hodge podge of shit, like getting lamia horns to be blood colored, fighting gabe newell bot for supremecy, making mild updates to LOMAT, the usual.<br><br>I'm experimenting with mailling list shit? So there might be a modal box or whatever on this page like exactly one time letting you know about it???
2019-01-12: The Start Year 3 is tomorrow on the Discord, hope you can join us :)<br><Br>I made it so the first Empress in WigglerSim is Shogun's Nameless Empress from SBURBSim on KR's suggestion.  Plus I've been rebranding the steam game to Farragnarok and looking into what it would take for achievements.
2019-01-10: Alright so LOHAE has a post ending minor update now and SBURBSim has KR's carapaces and....??? I think that's all I did today? (My isp is fucking up so uploads don't work so well so who even knows how much time i wasted fighting that)
2019-01-07: I've been bouncing around between doing meta farrago shit and working on getting LOMAT more and more game like.<br><br>For example, Gabe Newell bot got even more mad about LOHAE so we're renaming the steam version to "Farragnarok" just so we can use both "LOHAE" and "Land of Horticulture and Essence" in shit.
2019-01-04: Gabe Newell-Bot keeps rejecting LOHAE! Among other things, he's mad that "The Land of Horticulture and Essence" and "LOHAE" aren't the same name, so rather than stopping using the dual name system we're going to just give the game its own damn name unrelated to the leader's land. DM pointed out that Farrago and Ragnarok share some syllables and thus Farragnarok was born.
2019-01-01: Shit i loved IO's magical dolls so much I entered the CODE THROES and prototyped out <a href = 'MagicalGirlSim/index.html'>MagicalGirlSim</a> in two days. There's definitely room for growth in it, but it did a good job getting some of the kinks worked out in my brain thinking about single page app design. LOMAT is gonna be better than ever once I apply these new skillz to it!
2018-12-30: I spent the day getting IO's magical dolls into <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/DollSim/?type=45'>DollSim</a>. I live blogged my descent into madness (it takes two or so hours to get a new dollset in) on twitch, and sniperZee clipped me <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nziVeNBPMus'>losing my shit about a random doll</a>.
2018-12-29: Submitted LOHAE to valve for approval, we'll know in a few days if we're officially "coming soon" :) :) :)
2018-12-29: Spamming "adopt" for free in wiggler sim is no longer possible (no WONDER people kept draining the damn TIMEHOLE). While i was at it I also fixed this bug where you couldn't abandon wigglers if your empress didn't ALSO allow you to trade them.<br><br>Oh right I also murded this really old <a href ="DollSim/index.html">DollSim</a> link too.
2018-12-26: Wow, I finally got around to porting SBURBSim's newpost engine to the home page???
