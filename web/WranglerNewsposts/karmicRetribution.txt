2018-03-06: I don't think any of you understand how long I have been patiently, PATIENTLY sitting on those graphics of exploding dream moons without spoiling them. It's been terrible. <br><br><img src = 'images/misc/MOOOOON.gif'>
2017-08-05: Our newest staff member gets an avatar as well. Arise, Witch of Void!<Br><Br><img src = 'images/paradoxLands_kr.png'
2017-07-24: Hey, I keep forgetting to update this thing! Most of what I've been working on lately has gone towards adding fan classes. Head over to <a href='character_creator.html'>the character creator</a> if you want to check them out.
2017-06-28: A big shoutout and thanks to everyone who contributed art for the <a href='land_of_rods_and_screens.html'>Land of Rods and Screens</a> There's a lot of very weird, fun, and downright silly stuff in there. It's crazy-awesome that our little project here has such an amazing community already!<br><Br>Speaking of which, I have a favor to ask. I need photo reference for what people in High School are wearing. (That's students age 14-18 for the non-Americans.) I'd love to see all walks of life, dressed up, dressed down, you name it. Turns out it's surprisingly hard to find examples of actual people rather than fashion models and TV stars. Faces aren't necessary, just clothes. You can send photos to karmicRetribution001@gmail.com or thru private message on our Discord. Please don't leave me to source all my clothing from Seventeen and Teen Wolf!
2017-06-13: In honor of the best troll's birthday, I drew a little chibi of him. If you want to get your hands on the full-size inks, I've posted them as a backers-only post over on our new <a href = 'https://www.patreon.com/FarragoFiction'>Patreon</a>. You will always be able to see my work here on Farrago Fiction/SBURBSim, but bonus content may get posted there first, or in a higher quality, as a thank-you for those who choose to be our patrons.<br><br><img src = 'images/misc/Karkat_Color.png'>
2017-06-08: If the AuthorBot gets her own class, then ABjr, should as well, right? But I'd consider ABjr a Scout rather than a Guide, since she just goes out to find shit then wanders off without explaining anything. And occasionally lurks ominously in the bushes giggling at other people's misfortune. Or something like that. <br><Br><img src='images/authorbot_jr_scout.png'>
2017-06-02: Sometimes I just make stuff because jR wants it. The AuthorBot has earned a more independent identity, so now we have an official SBURBSim god-tier outfit for the Guide class. Go check out her page if you want to see it. <br><Br>There's also a couple of new secret images, if you can find them!
2017-05-20: I look at a LOT of sessions. Not as many as JR or AB, but still. And a good amount of the time, I'm actually skimming for specific scenes, or just tying to gauge the overall tone of a session. I thought it would be nice to have some graphical indicators of what each scene is about, and break up the text a bit more. So I made a bazillion tiny icons for different types of scenes. Some of them are only ever going to show up in the rarest of sessions, some are omnipresent.<br><Br>A couple are even animated. :wonk:
2017-05-12: Booyah - Check this shit out! jR has helped me implement a major visual overhaul for the site. Nifty backgrounds for most pages should be in place. Readability should be improved, and an overall more polished look might even convince people we know what we're doing!
2017-05-05: It just so happens that I have a fresh masterpiece for you, hot off the canvas and on to your computer where it will sizzle your eyeballs. Screwing with ghosts now comes with sweet special effects! Also, I am told that the main branch will soon have its header in place.<br><Br>PS: Dreambubbles and the afterlife are now a little less 'pediatrician's waiting room' and a little more 'unfathomable space outside of time.'
2017-04-21: Hey, look at that, an official site header! So fancy! That shit is a fucking symphony on my retinas.
2017-04-17:We are up to 60(!!) hairstyles, including all of the canon characters, even if I had to redraw hair for the ones that sucked. That's going to be all the hair for now - I'm going to move on to other items!
2017-04-14: <a href ='index2.html?lollipop=true'>TRICKSTER MODE ENGAGE!!!11!</a>
2017-04-13: Happy 413! I tried to finish out the hair for all the dancestors, but.... Kurloz. Seriously. His hair is too big to fit on the canvas. For NO REASON. He's not the Grand Highblood yet! I threw it out and made new hair that better reflects his talksprite. Anyway, I should be able to finish the rest soon. Did you know there are more than 50 hairstyles in the system already? Sheesh.
2017-04-05: Ugh tvros your hair is so ugly<Br>ur head's not even round<Br>look at this bullshit: <Br> <img src = 'images/tavroshead.png'>
2017-04-04: Muahahaha! Finally I have finished updating all of the existing sprites for hair and I can start adding new ones.
2017-03-31: Spent today chasing down visual bugs and eating them like a hungry baby dragon. Also banging my face against a scaling issue on the babies that was probably my fault in the first place. I standardized the size of all the rest of the images, but not the babies. Because I'm an idiot.<Br><Br>PS: Hyperrealistic grimdark flames are the best idea I've ever had.
2017-03-28: Here's some proper Dream jammies for all you ungrateful bastards on Reddit.
2017-03-28: Finished fixing up another handful of the worst hairstyles! jR figured out how to get the corrections working in the main branch as well, so you should all be able to see them.
2017-03-27: Death by stabs now includes a knife in the corpse, courtesy of the <a href='http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002228'>Midnight Crew</a>.
2017-03-23: There are currently 35 hairstyles. For stupid reasons related to my perfectionism, fixing up the hair sprites takes longer than any other sprite part, even the clothes. The few that are finished to my satisfaction are loaded into the <a href="http://purplefrog.com/~jenny/SburbStoryExperimental/newsposts.html">Experimental</a> branch. Making the images for this page has nothing to do with the delay on those, shut up.
2017-03-23:Why did I spend several hours drawing blank-faced babies in MS Paint?<p><img src='images/Bodies/baby.png'><p>BECAUSE BABY LEGS DON'T WORK THAT WAY, HUSSIE.<p>ahem.<p>Anyway, I want to show off my baby sprites at full size, so you can marvel at their little toes and stupid fingers.<p><img src='images/Bodies/baby1.png'><br><img src='images/Bodies/baby2.png'><br><img src='images/Bodies/baby3.png'>
2017-03-23: Cool, I get my own page!
2017-05-15:	â™£
2017-08-10:	I think it's fairly obvious where the visual inspiration for Guides and Scouts comes from. Girl Guides/Girl Scouts represent!
2017-09-13:	Hmmmm, I wonder where that came from?
2017-09-24:	Lords, you get to look like insufferable assholes no matter what stage of the journey you're on. You're welcome.
2018-01-26:	I've been patiently waiting on Smiths to be initialized. Finally I can truly be the ridiculous custom OC I was meant to be.
2018-02-01:	Oh no, not at all.
2018-02-08:	Faceless? Sure. Spineless? Well.... Come find out, buddy.
2018-02-12:	I'm not the most chatty staff member, but it's nice to have an easier way to update the news. Good idea, JR.
