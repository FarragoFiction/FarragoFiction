2019-11-10: I went on a brief hiatus to center myself, made an <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/AntSim'>AntSim</a> along with the team because taking actual breaks is apparently alien to me. Gonna get back to LOMAT next, feeling all refreshed and shit.<br><br> Oh right, we also entered it into a <a href = 'https://itch.io/jam/procjam/rate/514444'>game jam</a>.
2019-10-20: Along with yesterday's <a href = 'https://jadedresearcher.tumblr.com/post/188455287864/saturday-leak'>PODCAST LEAK</a>, the AudioLog system has been updated so that if you're sufficiently wasted it will let you know if there's an image or a Paldemic Chat associated with the passphrase.
2019-10-19: <a href = '/LOMATE'>LOMAT Experimental</a> lets you vote on tombstones and also FENRIR is there and he talks to you???
2019-10-06: <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/PaldemicSim/'>Paldemic</a> has had an update! You can now easily turn tumblr DMS (or similar things) into paldemic chats.
2019-10-01: On a whim I upgraded the bio system to also display any newspost by that particular wrangler AND did some mild secret gigglesnorting.
2019-09-28: During the week I updated LOMATE to have podcast support with tombstones, and today I upgraded WigglerSim to have alumni breeding. <br>(trophy items, like nearly all wigglersim assets, are made by IO, who almost never makes newsposts)
2019-09-22: Last weekend I did a doll slurp, this weekend I upgraded Events in <a href = '/LOMATE'>LOMAT Experimental</a> and next up I expect to allow breeding in WigglerSim.
2019-09-07: <a href  ="http://farragnarok.com/WorkersRights">ButlerBot</a> has learned about WorkersRights! He gets two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute to an hour lunch break. <br><br>He ALSO is capable of getting overwhelmed from too much input at once, especially if that input is aggressive or trying to hack him. He goes on a panic break when that happens.<br><br>He gets a salary too! He earns ButlerBux for every input he handles, and can spend them to say the fuck word to you guys when you overwhelm him. Capitalism at its finest.<br><br>Finally, heâ€™s capable of getting lonely too, if he goes too long without input. He might end up getting weird ideas about you guys if that happens for too long.
2019-09-05: You can put treebabs in the timehole again, and lohae grubs are adoptable again. Whoops.
2019-09-02: <a href = '/WigglerSim'>WigglerSim</a> has been upgraded to allow a mysterious change to occur to any grub that comes from LOHAE.
2019-08-31: I've been upgrading the TimeHole in preparation for THINGS, as well as making sure poor BB learns about Worker's Rights. <br><br>Plus did you know Saturday PodCast leaks are still a thing? This week's has one thats uncorrupt entirely so I figured I'd remind you guys about it: <a href = 'https://jadedresearcher.tumblr.com/post/187400805694/saturday-leak'>TumblrPost</a>
2019-08-18: Made a shit post gigglesnort lore <a href = "http://www.farragnarok.com/LiterallyAnyWrongURL">butler chat bot</a> 404 page that does text to speech for some reason? When shit gets stressful IRL I make weird shit. LOMAT continues, too. Newsletter is delayed because irl stress.
2019-08-03: I've been working on back end shit (like Conspiracy Sim) as well as just....jorb being so much more overtime-y than usual. BUT, <a href = '/LOMATE/index.html'>LOMAT</a> has an update! You can now put gigglesnort in your tombstones and other players will see it.
2019-07-20: BTW if you're following my <a href = 'https://jadedresearcher.tumblr.com/post/186425175029/saturday-podcast-leak'>tumblr</a> I've been posting podcast hints every Saturday. A password hint for you? Cactus wanted to tell everyone about his programming journey. <br><br>(jorb is still needing overtime, so LOMAT remains unchanged for a few more weeks)
2019-07-07: LOMAT has reached prototype status!  There's a full game in there, collecting npcs, dropping them off at locations, using the void to get to your destinations more efficiently, etc. The builder is DONE but the contest winners and wranglers are still fleshing out the npcs. <br><br>Going forwards I'm going to beef up the builders, really let the npcs be the focus of the game. I also need to tweak values of everything for a 'fun' experience, AND I wanted to make sure there were special premade towns full of dumb shit.
2019-06-29: Shhh, only <a href = 'AudioLogs/loras2.html'>LORAS2</a> now.
2019-06-28: LOMAT npc building is nearly done, which is the last major feature before we go alpha.
2019-06-25: I get I cultivate a space where people feel safe hacking and etc, and I normally am all FOR that, but whoever filled the TIMEHOLE with alumni crashed a lot of people's saves and that is NOT okay. I've disabled non grubs being yeeted into the hole.
2019-06-23: LOMAT nearly has gulls ready for slurping, the AudioLogs got another pass of functionality, and I made the single best <a href = 'TurtleSim'>shit post addendum</a> of my life, with the help of the FarragoFictionFandom.
2019-06-16: Hahahah i forgot to keep posting here. <a href = 'https://mailchi.mp/f0fbf8d05e97/june-farrago-rambles-and-secrets'>Newsletter tho</a>. <br><br>Also its ironic that although the <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/AudioLogs?passPhrase=herstory'>PodcastEngine</a> has been out a for a few days,  its only today that it will get mentioned here. Today, on the day that the indie game <a target = '_blank' href = 'http://www.herstorygame.com/'>''Her Story'</a> takes place, which ended up being retroactively heavy inspiration for it. <br><br>Also, cactus, tg, pl and I collaborated to fix up yards yet again for SBURBSimE. Classpect update chugs along.
2019-06-14: We're welcoming the newest wrangler, cactus! They'll be helping code new sims, and debugging old ones. :) :) :) We'll get a bio page set up for 'em shortly.
2019-06-01: We've been working really hard on something [REDACTED] and I am so damn excited about it. It will really be a way to let us get content to ya'll in a more linear fashion. <br><Br>Meanwhile, WIGGLERSIM has an update that lets you resist the unstoppable fuchsia hoards from teh TIMEHOLE!!! Every fuchsia you get from the TIMEHOLE will come, free of charge, with a PURPLE ARADIA DOLL, which will let you randomize the caste of any wigglers that interact with it.<br><Br>PLUS the <a href = 'https://farrago-fiction.myshopify.com/products/farragnarok-coin-01-lohae?_ga=2.164139639.915621423.1559361900-767913623.1554759524'>LOHAE COINS</a> are available for public sale! Act now if you want to reserve your favorite number! PlUS, you can click <a href = 'http://farragnarok.com/lohaecoinraffle'>here</a> to see how you, yes YOU, can get  a LORAS style micro game made for a land tailored to you! :) :) :)
2019-05-29: Doll slurp!!!
2019-05-21: We got our Ludum results back! We got great feedback overall on our strengths and weaknesses, and we'll be doing a minor polish pass over our game to work out some of the more obvious problems with our gameplay loop (and make it less confusing!). Feel free to compare <a  target = '_blank' href = "http://farragofiction.com/LudumDare/Spring2019/">Game Jam Version</a> with the <a  target = '_blank' href = "MagicalGirlSim/index.html">Polished Version</a> as time goes on :)  <br><br> PLUS, don't forget about our original Magical Girl Game with suprisingly no twists: <a  target = '_blank' href = "MagicalGirlSim/nicesim.html">Magical Girl Sim</a>
2019-05-14: We're experimenting with short form in char and out of character <a href = 'https://www.patreon.com/posts/26861909'>podcasts</a> for gigglesnort. The first is live for patrons of God Giver tier and up, but we also have a temporary corrupt version to satisfy the wider gigglesnort needs.<br><br>The corrupt version has hints the uncorrupt version won't, just to make up for being less interesting. The uncorrupt version will go public soonish, and we'll slowly trickle a few out, though the intent is for the majority of the files to be related to a mysterious puzzle we're definitely not working on.<Br><br>
2019-05-13: My experience sending babies through time made me become complacent, and in my hubris I attempted to make ALL SBURBSim rendering asyncronous (which would be the first step to getting DollSim in).<br><br>After about two days of dedicated code throes I ended up concluding the same thing my past selves had: It would be a HUGE undertaking. Maybe 9 months at my current free time level. <br><Br>We absolutely do plan to make a SBURBSim2 one day though, built from the ground up to use the doll engine, and with even more features on top of SBURBSim, with a more stable foundation.<br><br>I know how much some people have been looking forward to it though, and I really am sorry (and disappointed myself) it shook out this way.
2019-05-12: Got some upgrades to SBURBSimE, including new AI stuff for TG's and AW's impending update. PLUS i defeated a few image loading bugs via making babies transcend TIME ITSELF.
2019-05-09: Got some better npc mechanics in place for LOMAT, which includes a more finalized rendering engine, and npcs actually existin in physical space now (by which i mean if they are inyour party you can't recruit them)
2019-05-07: <a href = 'https://mailchi.mp/e9037787cf9c/april-farrago-rambles-and-secrets'>Newsletter</a> out.
2019-05-06: hahah oh wow you guys. Like, seriously. So FIRST thing was we participated in the <a href = 'https://ldjam.com/'>Ludum Dare</a>, which is where you make an entire whole ass <a href = 'https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/mahou-shoujo-monster-promised-fate'>GAME</a> in 72 hours. Ours was a horror game starring IO's magical girl dollset, and I'm super proud of it :) :) :). <br><bR>Then I got a p bad cold for like, a week.<br><br>And THEN I did some bug fixes in <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/SBURBSimE'>SBURBSimE</a>??? And somewhere in there was a doll slurp? <br><br>Wow I'm bad at newsposts guys.
2019-04-21: <a href = '/LOMATE'> LOMAT</a>got a decently sized update. Hunting is fully wired into the funds system, consorts have random names, AND they actually leave the party when they get where they are going. <br><br>Basically, we're starting to have an actual gameplay loop! We've got the basic ideas of what we want the last few pieces of it to be, then the proof of concept just needs calibrated adn fiddled with and we'll be read to update both steam and regular LOMAT to have the final "demo". <br><Br>After that, its really just throwing the final plot and art assets everywhere and making sure all the secrets are redacted enough.
2019-04-19: Wish doll slurps didn't take so much out of me, but one is done again! This adds way more parts to the <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/DollSim'>DollSim</a> and its most popular derivative, <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/WigglerSim'>WigglerSim</a>. Thanks to all the talented artists (both wrangler and non) who contributed!
2019-04-11: Caretakers are done! You can set up your profile (and will have to to use the timehole), but even without it you can do things like look at the <a href = 'www.farragofiction.com/WigglerSim/caretaker.html?score=board&sort=total_points'>scoreboards!</a><br><br>Hahah whoops the entire concept of items has been restored to the collective unconsciousness.
2019-04-09: Caretakers turn out to be harder than expected???
2019-04-03: Gonna add a caretaker update to WigglerSim. Also working on revamping the <a href = 'https://www.patreon.com/FarragoFiction'>Patreon</a>.
2019-04-01: <a href = 'https://sburbsimulator.fandom.com/wiki/Farrago_Fiction_April_Fools_2019_Puzzle_(OdinsRazor/85)'> Loki Waits.</a>
2019-03-31: Been doing lots of things here and there for LOMAT and upgrading things for a dollslurp when I suddenly realized that SBURBSim is probably still going to go into auto-prank mode on the first. That is hilarious, and I wonder if it will break anything.
2019-03-22: <a href = '/LOMATE'>LOMAT</a> got a huge upgrade, having diseases fully out with procedural names and descriptions. Even town names are fully procedural now. I even wrote a quick bot to help test things out and for definitely no other purpose ;)<br><br>And before I forget we have a new <a href = 'https://mailchi.mp/47945716969b/march-farrago-rambles-and-secrets'>newsletter</a> montly post out :) :) :) YN described it as being like a letter to Princess Celestia but about killing.
2019-03-19: PL and me have been fighting past me's shitty json code, and wigglersim is finally upgraded to dart 2.0. this has no actual practical effect just yet, but needed done.<br><br>Well, okay there's ONE effect, from a bug I found while trying to debug someones save data. WigglerSim will no longer send you careening into the void on a typo rocket if you happen to try to use compressed save data to load a backup.
2019-03-16: spent the past bit working on LOMAT (nothing in the game yet but lots of foundation) and playing around with a really neat animation technique PL taught me.
2019-03-03: The tombstone engine went live just now, been hacking away on it little by little.  Its not 100% done or anything, but its at least wired into the core gameplay loop.
2019-02-23: I used needing to chill as an excuse to hack some <a href = 'https://tyranobuilder.com/'>TyrannoBuilder</a> output manic made as a test for something.  Nothing to see <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/AfterlifeSim/'>here</a>, definitely no gigglesnort.<br><br>Basically, using that third party tool means that the wranglers can work semi-independantly rather than waiting on my busy ass to get shit done.
2019-02-20: At this point I'm recovering from the steam release, but in the mean time enjoy these two fan-built sburbsim mods: <Br><Br><a target= "_blank" href="https://mostlikely-human.github.io/SBURBSimulator/main/web/index2.html">MLH SBURBSim Mod</a>, <a target= "_blank" href="https://acactusorsomething.github.io/ZBURBZimulator/index2.html">Cactus SBURBSim Mod</a>
2019-02-15: New arc num secured :) :) :) <a href ='https://store.steampowered.com/app/929640/Farragnarok/'>Farragnarok is out on steam</a>!<br><Br>It comes with its own <a href = 'http://www.farragnarok.com'>snazzy new website</a>, too!
2019-02-11: I defeated PHP just long enough to get a <a href ="http://www.farragnarok.com/presskit/index.php">PressKit</a> set up just like a real game company.
2019-02-07: Little by little I'm figuring out how to wire the achievements into LOHAE. (stats seem right out they just don't work)
2019-02-03: GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did it! It took liek a week off and on but I am UNLOCKING LOHAE ACHIEVEMENTS IN STEAM! I just gotta wire it into LOHAE proper but holy shit do I feel powerful!!!
2019-01-27: <a href ="http://farragofiction.com/LOMATE/tombstonetest.html">LOMAT Experimental</a> has a proof of concept out for how i want the online tombstones to work. Basically you make fridge poetry to share with other players of how your poor sqwawking ghost died.
2019-01-19: WigglerSim is updated to use PL's new system (wow i forgot entirely about that) which ALSO lets WigglerSim have the rainbow horns for Lamia.
2019-01-18: This is a canon mutation and only kr can stop me: <br><img src = 'images/newspostImages/rainbowHorns.gif'>
2019-01-17: Been working on a hodge podge of shit, like getting lamia horns to be blood colored, fighting gabe newell bot for supremecy, making mild updates to LOMAT, the usual.<br><br>I'm experimenting with mailling list shit? So there might be a modal box or whatever on this page like exactly one time letting you know about it???
2019-01-12: The Start Year 3 is tomorrow on the Discord, hope you can join us :)<br><Br>I made it so the first Empress in WigglerSim is Shogun's Nameless Empress from SBURBSim on KR's suggestion.  Plus I've been rebranding the steam game to Farragnarok and looking into what it would take for achievements.
2019-01-10: Alright so LOHAE has a post ending minor update now and SBURBSim has KR's carapaces and....??? I think that's all I did today? (My isp is fucking up so uploads don't work so well so who even knows how much time i wasted fighting that)
2019-01-07: I've been bouncing around between doing meta farrago shit and working on getting LOMAT more and more game like.<br><br>For example, Gabe Newell bot got even more mad about LOHAE so we're renaming the steam version to "Farragnarok" just so we can use both "LOHAE" and "Land of Horticulture and Essence" in shit.
2019-01-04: Gabe Newell-Bot keeps rejecting LOHAE! Among other things, he's mad that "The Land of Horticulture and Essence" and "LOHAE" aren't the same name, so rather than stopping using the dual name system we're going to just give the game its own damn name unrelated to the leader's land. DM pointed out that Farrago and Ragnarok share some syllables and thus Farragnarok was born.
2019-01-01: Shit i loved IO's magical dolls so much I entered the CODE THROES and prototyped out <a href = 'MagicalGirlSim/index.html'>MagicalGirlSim</a> in two days. There's definitely room for growth in it, but it did a good job getting some of the kinks worked out in my brain thinking about single page app design. LOMAT is gonna be better than ever once I apply these new skillz to it!
2018-12-30: I spent the day getting IO's magical dolls into <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/DollSim/?type=45'>DollSim</a>. I live blogged my descent into madness (it takes two or so hours to get a new dollset in) on twitch, and sniperZee clipped me <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nziVeNBPMus'>losing my shit about a random doll</a>.
2018-12-29: Submitted LOHAE to valve for approval, we'll know in a few days if we're officially "coming soon" :) :) :)
2018-12-29: Spamming "adopt" for free in wiggler sim is no longer possible (no WONDER people kept draining the damn TIMEHOLE). While i was at it I also fixed this bug where you couldn't abandon wigglers if your empress didn't ALSO allow you to trade them.<br><br>Oh right I also murded this really old <a href ="DollSim/index.html">DollSim</a> link too.
2018-12-26: Wow, I finally got around to porting SBURBSim's newpost engine to the home page???
