2019-05-13: My experience sending babies through time made me become complacent, and in my hubris I attempted to make ALL SBURBSim rendering asyncronous (which would be the first step to getting DollSim in).<br><br>After about two days of dedicated code throes I ended up concluding the same thing my past selves had: It would be a HUGE undertaking. Maybe 9 months at my current free time level. <br><Br>We absolutely do plan to make a SBURBSim2 one day though, built from the ground up to use the doll engine, and with even more features on top of SBURBSim, with a more stable foundation.<br><br>I know how much some people have been looking forward to it though, and I really am sorry (and disappointed myself) it shook out this way.
2019-05-12: Got some upgrades to SBURBSimE, including new AI stuff for TG's and AW's impending update. PLUS i defeated a few image loading bugs via making babies transcend TIME ITSELF.
2019-05-09: Got some better npc mechanics in place for LOMAT, which includes a more finalized rendering engine, and npcs actually existin in physical space now (by which i mean if they are inyour party you can't recruit them)
2019-05-07: <a href = 'https://mailchi.mp/e9037787cf9c/april-farrago-rambles-and-secrets'>Newsletter</a> out.
2019-05-06: hahah oh wow you guys. Like, seriously. So FIRST thing was we participated in the <a href = 'https://ldjam.com/'>Ludum Dare</a>, which is where you make an entire whole ass <a href = 'https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/mahou-shoujo-monster-promised-fate'>GAME</a> in 72 hours. Ours was a horror game starring IO's magical girl dollset, and I'm super proud of it :) :) :). <br><bR>Then I got a p bad cold for like, a week.<br><br>And THEN I did some bug fixes in <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/SBURBSimE'>SBURBSimE</a>??? And somewhere in there was a doll slurp? <br><br>Wow I'm bad at newsposts guys.
2019-04-21: <a href = '/LOMATE'> LOMAT</a>got a decently sized update. Hunting is fully wired into the funds system, consorts have random names, AND they actually leave the party when they get where they are going. <br><br>Basically, we're starting to have an actual gameplay loop! We've got the basic ideas of what we want the last few pieces of it to be, then the proof of concept just needs calibrated adn fiddled with and we'll be read to update both steam and regular LOMAT to have the final "demo". <br><Br>After that, its really just throwing the final plot and art assets everywhere and making sure all the secrets are redacted enough.
2019-04-19: Wish doll slurps didn't take so much out of me, but one is done again! This adds way more parts to the <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/DollSim'>DollSim</a> and its most popular derivative, <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/WigglerSim'>WigglerSim</a>. Thanks to all the talented artists (both wrangler and non) who contributed!
2019-04-11: Caretakers are done! You can set up your profile (and will have to to use the timehole), but even without it you can do things like look at the <a href = 'www.farragofiction.com/WigglerSim/caretaker.html?score=board&sort=total_points'>scoreboards!</a><br><br>Hahah whoops the entire concept of items has been restored to the collective unconsciousness.
2019-04-09: Caretakers turn out to be harder than expected???
2019-04-03: Gonna add a caretaker update to WigglerSim. Also working on revamping the <a href = 'https://www.patreon.com/FarragoFiction'>Patreon</a>.
2019-04-01: <a href = 'https://sburbsimulator.fandom.com/wiki/Farrago_Fiction_April_Fools_2019_Puzzle_(OdinsRazor/85)'> Loki Waits.</a>
2019-03-31: Been doing lots of things here and there for LOMAT and upgrading things for a dollslurp when I suddenly realized that SBURBSim is probably still going to go into auto-prank mode on the first. That is hilarious, and I wonder if it will break anything.
2019-03-22: <a href = '/LOMATE'>LOMAT</a> got a huge upgrade, having diseases fully out with procedural names and descriptions. Even town names are fully procedural now. I even wrote a quick bot to help test things out and for definitely no other purpose ;)<br><br>And before I forget we have a new <a href = 'https://mailchi.mp/47945716969b/march-farrago-rambles-and-secrets'>newsletter</a> montly post out :) :) :) YN described it as being like a letter to Princess Celestia but about killing.
2019-03-19: PL and me have been fighting past me's shitty json code, and wigglersim is finally upgraded to dart 2.0. this has no actual practical effect just yet, but needed done.<br><br>Well, okay there's ONE effect, from a bug I found while trying to debug someones save data. WigglerSim will no longer send you careening into the void on a typo rocket if you happen to try to use compressed save data to load a backup.
2019-03-16: spent the past bit working on LOMAT (nothing in the game yet but lots of foundation) and playing around with a really neat animation technique PL taught me.
2019-03-03: The tombstone engine went live just now, been hacking away on it little by little.  Its not 100% done or anything, but its at least wired into the core gameplay loop.
2019-02-23: I used needing to chill as an excuse to hack some <a href = 'https://tyranobuilder.com/'>TyrannoBuilder</a> output manic made as a test for something.  Nothing to see <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/AfterlifeSim/'>here</a>, definitely no gigglesnort.<br><br>Basically, using that third party tool means that the wranglers can work semi-independantly rather than waiting on my busy ass to get shit done.
2019-02-20: At this point I'm recovering from the steam release, but in the mean time enjoy these two fan-built sburbsim mods: <Br><Br><a target= "_blank" href="https://mostlikely-human.github.io/SBURBSimulator/main/web/index2.html">MLH SBURBSim Mod</a>, <a target= "_blank" href="https://acactusorsomething.github.io/ZBURBZimulator/index2.html">Cactus SBURBSim Mod</a>
2019-02-15: New arc num secured :) :) :) <a href ='https://store.steampowered.com/app/929640/Farragnarok/'>Farragnarok is out on steam</a>!<br><Br>It comes with its own <a href = 'http://www.farragnarok.com'>snazzy new website</a>, too!
2019-02-11: I defeated PHP just long enough to get a <a href ="http://www.farragnarok.com/presskit/index.php">PressKit</a> set up just like a real game company.
2019-02-07: Little by little I'm figuring out how to wire the achievements into LOHAE. (stats seem right out they just don't work)
2019-02-03: GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did it! It took liek a week off and on but I am UNLOCKING LOHAE ACHIEVEMENTS IN STEAM! I just gotta wire it into LOHAE proper but holy shit do I feel powerful!!!
2019-01-27: <a href ="http://farragofiction.com/LOMATE/tombstonetest.html">LOMAT Experimental</a> has a proof of concept out for how i want the online tombstones to work. Basically you make fridge poetry to share with other players of how your poor sqwawking ghost died.
2019-01-19: WigglerSim is updated to use PL's new system (wow i forgot entirely about that) which ALSO lets WigglerSim have the rainbow horns for Lamia.
2019-01-18: This is a canon mutation and only kr can stop me: <br><img src = 'images/newspostImages/rainbowHorns.gif'>
2019-01-17: Been working on a hodge podge of shit, like getting lamia horns to be blood colored, fighting gabe newell bot for supremecy, making mild updates to LOMAT, the usual.<br><br>I'm experimenting with mailling list shit? So there might be a modal box or whatever on this page like exactly one time letting you know about it???
2019-01-12: The Start Year 3 is tomorrow on the Discord, hope you can join us :)<br><Br>I made it so the first Empress in WigglerSim is Shogun's Nameless Empress from SBURBSim on KR's suggestion.  Plus I've been rebranding the steam game to Farragnarok and looking into what it would take for achievements.
2019-01-10: Alright so LOHAE has a post ending minor update now and SBURBSim has KR's carapaces and....??? I think that's all I did today? (My isp is fucking up so uploads don't work so well so who even knows how much time i wasted fighting that)
2019-01-07: I've been bouncing around between doing meta farrago shit and working on getting LOMAT more and more game like.<br><br>For example, Gabe Newell bot got even more mad about LOHAE so we're renaming the steam version to "Farragnarok" just so we can use both "LOHAE" and "Land of Horticulture and Essence" in shit.
2019-01-04: Gabe Newell-Bot keeps rejecting LOHAE! Among other things, he's mad that "The Land of Horticulture and Essence" and "LOHAE" aren't the same name, so rather than stopping using the dual name system we're going to just give the game its own damn name unrelated to the leader's land. DM pointed out that Farrago and Ragnarok share some syllables and thus Farragnarok was born.
2019-01-01: Shit i loved IO's magical dolls so much I entered the CODE THROES and prototyped out <a href = 'MagicalGirlSim/index.html'>MagicalGirlSim</a> in two days. There's definitely room for growth in it, but it did a good job getting some of the kinks worked out in my brain thinking about single page app design. LOMAT is gonna be better than ever once I apply these new skillz to it!
2018-12-30: I spent the day getting IO's magical dolls into <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/DollSim/?type=45'>DollSim</a>. I live blogged my descent into madness (it takes two or so hours to get a new dollset in) on twitch, and sniperZee clipped me <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nziVeNBPMus'>losing my shit about a random doll</a>.
2018-12-29: Submitted LOHAE to valve for approval, we'll know in a few days if we're officially "coming soon" :) :) :)
2018-12-29: Spamming "adopt" for free in wiggler sim is no longer possible (no WONDER people kept draining the damn TIMEHOLE). While i was at it I also fixed this bug where you couldn't abandon wigglers if your empress didn't ALSO allow you to trade them.<br><br>Oh right I also murded this really old <a href ="DollSim/index.html">DollSim</a> link too.
2018-12-26: Wow, I finally got around to porting SBURBSim's newpost engine to the home page???
