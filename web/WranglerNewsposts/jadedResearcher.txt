2019-03-19: PL and me have been fighting past me's shitty json code, and wigglersim is finally upgraded to dart 2.0. this has no actual practical effect just yet, but needed done.<br><br>Well, okay there's ONE effect, from a bug I found while trying to debug someones save data. WigglerSim will no longer send you careening into the void on a typo rocket if you happen to try to use compressed save data to load a backup.
2019-03-16: spent the past bit working on LOMAT (nothing in the game yet but lots of foundation) and playing around with a really neat animation technique PL taught me.
2019-03-03: The tombstone engine went live just now, been hacking away on it little by little.  Its not 100% done or anything, but its at least wired into the core gameplay loop.
2019-02-23: I used needing to chill as an excuse to hack some <a href = 'https://tyranobuilder.com/'>TyrannoBuilder</a> output manic made as a test for something.  Nothing to see <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/AfterlifeSim/'>here</a>, definitely no gigglesnort.<br><br>Basically, using that third party tool means that the wranglers can work semi-independantly rather than waiting on my busy ass to get shit done.
2019-02-20: At this point I'm recovering from the steam release, but in the mean time enjoy these two fan-built sburbsim mods: <Br><Br><a target= "_blank" href="https://mostlikely-human.github.io/SBURBSimulator/main/web/index2.html">MLH SBURBSim Mod</a>, <a target= "_blank" href="https://acactusorsomething.github.io/ZBURBZimulator/index2.html">Cactus SBURBSim Mod</a>
2019-02-15: New arc num secured :) :) :) <a href ='https://store.steampowered.com/app/929640/Farragnarok/'>Farragnarok is out on steam</a>!<br><Br>It comes with its own <a href = 'http://www.farragnarok.com'>snazzy new website</a>, too!
2019-02-11: I defeated PHP just long enough to get a <a href ="http://www.farragnarok.com/presskit/index.php">PressKit</a> set up just like a real game company.
2019-02-07: Little by little I'm figuring out how to wire the achievements into LOHAE. (stats seem right out they just don't work)
2019-02-03: GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did it! It took liek a week off and on but I am UNLOCKING LOHAE ACHIEVEMENTS IN STEAM! I just gotta wire it into LOHAE proper but holy shit do I feel powerful!!!
2019-01-27: <a href ="http://farragofiction.com/LOMATE/tombstonetest.html">LOMAT Experimental</a> has a proof of concept out for how i want the online tombstones to work. Basically you make fridge poetry to share with other players of how your poor sqwawking ghost died.
2019-01-19: WigglerSim is updated to use PL's new system (wow i forgot entirely about that) which ALSO lets WigglerSim have the rainbow horns for Lamia.
2019-01-18: This is a canon mutation and only kr can stop me: <br><img src = 'images/newspostImages/rainbowHorns.gif'>
2019-01-17: Been working on a hodge podge of shit, like getting lamia horns to be blood colored, fighting gabe newell bot for supremecy, making mild updates to LOMAT, the usual.<br><br>I'm experimenting with mailling list shit? So there might be a modal box or whatever on this page like exactly one time letting you know about it???
2019-01-12: The Start Year 3 is tomorrow on the Discord, hope you can join us :)<br><Br>I made it so the first Empress in WigglerSim is Shogun's Nameless Empress from SBURBSim on KR's suggestion.  Plus I've been rebranding the steam game to Farragnarok and looking into what it would take for achievements.
2019-01-10: Alright so LOHAE has a post ending minor update now and SBURBSim has KR's carapaces and....??? I think that's all I did today? (My isp is fucking up so uploads don't work so well so who even knows how much time i wasted fighting that)
2019-01-07: I've been bouncing around between doing meta farrago shit and working on getting LOMAT more and more game like.<br><br>For example, Gabe Newell bot got even more mad about LOHAE so we're renaming the steam version to "Farragnarok" just so we can use both "LOHAE" and "Land of Horticulture and Essence" in shit.
2019-01-04: Gabe Newell-Bot keeps rejecting LOHAE! Among other things, he's mad that "The Land of Horticulture and Essence" and "LOHAE" aren't the same name, so rather than stopping using the dual name system we're going to just give the game its own damn name unrelated to the leader's land. DM pointed out that Farrago and Ragnarok share some syllables and thus Farragnarok was born.
2019-01-01: Shit i loved IO's magical dolls so much I entered the CODE THROES and prototyped out <a href = 'MagicalGirlSim/index.html'>MagicalGirlSim</a> in two days. There's definitely room for growth in it, but it did a good job getting some of the kinks worked out in my brain thinking about single page app design. LOMAT is gonna be better than ever once I apply these new skillz to it!
2018-12-30: I spent the day getting IO's magical dolls into <a href = 'http://www.farragofiction.com/DollSim/?type=45'>DollSim</a>. I live blogged my descent into madness (it takes two or so hours to get a new dollset in) on twitch, and sniperZee clipped me <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nziVeNBPMus'>losing my shit about a random doll</a>.
2018-12-29: Submitted LOHAE to valve for approval, we'll know in a few days if we're officially "coming soon" :) :) :)
2018-12-29: Spamming "adopt" for free in wiggler sim is no longer possible (no WONDER people kept draining the damn TIMEHOLE). While i was at it I also fixed this bug where you couldn't abandon wigglers if your empress didn't ALSO allow you to trade them.<br><br>Oh right I also murded this really old <a href ="DollSim/index.html">DollSim</a> link too.
2018-12-26: Wow, I finally got around to porting SBURBSim's newpost engine to the home page???
