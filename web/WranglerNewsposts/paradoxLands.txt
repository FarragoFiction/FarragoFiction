2018-05-02: I hear AB has decided to take up writing fanfiction... and that all JR headcanons are true. <span class="void"><br><br>I finally ported a random text generation system that I wrote from JS to Dart, with plenty of improvements. This is the test case, with plenty more applications to come in future!</span>
2018-04-27: Minor updates to <a href="observatory.html">The Observatory</a>, nothing to be concerned about. <span class="void">Except the new, hidden thing which is now out there to find. It's perhaps the single fanciest thing in the whole sim at the time of writing! Good luck!</span>
2018-03-31: <a href="observatory.html">The Observatory</a> is now open for your viewing pleasure, with a map of all sessions to be found in the sim<span class="void"> including all the special ones</span>.<br><br>It's a good way to check out the lands of each session, too!<span class="void"><br><br>But watch out for horrorterrors...</span>
2017-10-31: 	First you make the lands, then you shout at people for failing quests on them. <span class = 'void'><br><br>Then you make sure the system allows enough flexibility to be useful as a basis for generating land images later. <br>Lots of work went into a tag and theme system which should allow a rich and featureful description of each land capable of producing a good quality landscape for each one. <br>Down the line this will be important in generating objects which are needed to fill in the land and make it more alive.</span>
2017-07-20: 	[REDACTED] <span class = 'void'>The refactor is underway, and it is messy and slow. Initially over 200,000 errors, progress has been good.</span>
2017-07-17: 	Switching everything over to Dart will be a huge plus for future projects. <span class = 'void'>Exactly how much can't really be understated - the sim at its current size is already suffering from typo entropy from being so dang large, never mind the gains from using a proper system of inheritance.</span>
2017-06-24:	Hi. <span class = 'void'>I come to break everything and make it anew (and eventually make sweet procedural land art)</span>
