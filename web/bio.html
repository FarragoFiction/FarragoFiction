					Long long ago, in the far away past of 2017, JR had a very important Decision to make. What would they do while waiting for Hiveswap to come out, which was DEFINITELY going to come out in January and you would be a fool for suggesting otherwise. They decided to try their hand at making a "roguelike" SBURBSim game that played itself and was different every time. The rest is history. Miraculously, the Sim didn't end when Hiveswap came out like eleven fucking months later.
					<br><br>
					JR enjoys coding, coding some more, doing stupid shit (usually involving code) and packing literally everything as full of secrets, easter eggs, and lucky charms as they can get.
					<br><br>
					JR is a sadistic puzzle master and definitely not bad at secrets.  Their Denizen is Janus, and it became retroactively a refrance to the Sim being founded in January.
					<br><br>
					All JR headcanons are true. Write your own, or let AB decide!<br><br>

					So have you ever gotten interested in a friend's project, and then thought "Oh look, there's a small thing I can help them with! It should only take a few minutes, even!" And a few weeks later you found yourself using all of your spare time to work on the project?
					Yeah.
<br><br>
					Anyway, I'm karmicRetribution, Smith of Dream (because canon is for plebs), and I did most of the foundational graphics work on the sim. I try to stop JR from hate-macking on good taste so that we can all enjoy looking at the site instead of clawing our eyes out.
<br><br>


					Also, I accidentally enabled the Shogun's ascension. Whoops, my bad.

					Behold Observer. Gaze upon the illusive and unbelievably dashing answer to the eternal question that is; “Who is Shogun?” I am the Shogun of Sauce, The Lord of Words, the Antithesis and so much more.
					<br><br>It goes without saying that I am unimaginably amazing and utterly baffling to try and understand. All you lore hogs out there will find not a scrape of my backstory by digging around where you think I can’t see you.
					<br><br>I bet you’re asking yourself; “Shogun, how did you possibly end up here on this page, where people who do useful stuff for the Sim end up?” Well let me tell you two things;
					<ol>
					<br><li>	I do what I want</li>
					<br><li>How dare you imply I haven’t done anything useful for this. I’ve at least had my face slapped on the homepage.</li>
					</ol>
					<br><br>You might see me coming to visit your pitiful session some day. In which case, I can offer this advice. Good luck Observer. You’ll need all that Light can give you and more.

					Before joining the Wranglers, tableGuardian played board games with a group of friends known as LEGEND. Due to unfortunate circumstances, no one else in LEGEND received their copy of SBURB, and so he entered the Wranglers.
					<br><br>TG’s signature ability is [Be The Arms]. This allows him to convert parts of his physical body into arms made of heart-stuff. The more arms he creates, the less control he has over his physical body. These arms can be used to compel changes in pre-existing emotions of a target. It is typically used as a support ability. TG allegedly learned it from reading a book in some ruin on his land.
					<br><br>TG likes to make his own tabletop games, make spreadsheet tables, and (on rare occasions) physically merge with tables. He also enjoys listening to music and has a strange obsession with “the final boss,” which definitely isn’t the Black King.
					<br><br>In his spare time, TG goes through the “heart” of the sim, pointing out its flaws and allowing them to be changed. He has no idea how to write code himself like a mind player would, but knows when something feels wrong.
