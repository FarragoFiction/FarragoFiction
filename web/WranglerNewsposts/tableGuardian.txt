2019-11-17: Welcome to Main Branch, Carapace and Classpect update! May your balance be fair and your simulation times be brief!
2019-09-28: <a href = '/SBURBSimE'>All carapaces</a> have had their initial versions complete. The two culinary carapaces now have their own Crowning scenes, and every carapace has been given scenes in which they help the player who recruited them somehow (except PM and ZC, because they already do the whole mail quest thing). There's definitely still some bugs/typos for me to work out, but for the time being, the carapace AI is in a good state.
2019-07-18: Carapace AI updates continue: WV grants his leader some rebellion members as strife allies, while AR grants something similar but in the form of police sidekicks.
2019-06-11: Muses no longer grant Pluck Tokens to nonplayers. I'd seen them grant pluck tokens to Jack Noir and the Black King before I patched this out. At least it's not like they could use them or anything.
2019-06-08: All current classes and aspects have been given an AI Scene Engine-based overhaul. Players can do sidequests (based on their class) to gain Pluck Tokens, which are used to fuel powers (based on their aspect). Additionally, our resident carapace cooks and collectors have been given minor adjustments.
